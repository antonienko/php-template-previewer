PHP Template Previewer
======================

PHP template _previewer_ for designers testing their framework views without the working backend code.

Originally created for a personal project using the Phalcon PHP framework and its templating system Volt.

##Disclaimer:
This is my first composer as well as open source project, so if you see anything that needs improving, don't hesitate
and tell me.
